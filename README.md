# week-5
This project was designed for Rice University coding bootcamp.

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Getting Started
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/wangjiayususan/week-5.git)

[Deployed Github IO](https://wangjiayususan.github.io/week-5/)

## Summary
- HTML, CSS, and Javascript documents create a coding quiz.
- The starter code uses the Moment.js (Links to an external site.) library to work with date and time, but feel free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality since Moment.js is considered a "legacy" project.
